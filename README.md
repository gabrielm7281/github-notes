# Github-Notes

### <b>Git</b>
Git is the original coding spot for people who needed it. It had all the features you would expect but also has version control, allowing you to see previous coding history. 

### Github
Github allows you to do all the same things as Git, but in a managable and easy to use website. It implements the same version control for you to use, like in the history button. It also shows a preview of certain files such as this README document. It is the central place to share for a lot of intresting projects that random people have created

### Repo
A repo(sitory) is just a place where you put your files and code. For example: This README is in a repo that stores the doc and saves everything that I have created within the repo. 

### Commit 
Commit is basically the save button for Github. In order to actually save your progress and everything you have made so far needs to be saved, so the commit button tells the site when to save that data for later. It also creates a tag unique to this repo for identification.
